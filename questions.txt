CMPUT 379 Assignment #3

1.
  a) file1, file2, file7, file8 are separate and unique. file3, file4, file5, file6 are not.
  b) The 2 denotes the number of links/directories inside this new directory.
     An empty directory has 2 because it has two links: '.' (point to directory itself)
     and '..' (pointing to the parent).
  c) Nothing happens because just a file was copied, but a directory.
  d) The 2 changes to a 3.  This happens because the directory now contains another directory
     so the link/directory count is incremented.

2.
  a) No, the original shows no trace of the symbolic link.
  b) No indication.
  c) Symbolic link to a file that doesn't exist: it creates link without warning
     Symbolic link then file deleted: deletes file without warning, link remains

3.
  a) After creating the hard link the links/directories count for the linked file increased.
     In 2b this didn't happen because it was only a symbolic link.
  b) Both the original file and the hard link ls -l stats update (the permissions and modification time).
  c) Aside from the name there is no way to tell the difference.  They are essentially two names
     that point to the exact same thing.
  d) The hard link continues to exist, and file can still be opened (the file contents still exist).
  e) Directory: hard links are not allowed for a directory
     Non-existent file: hard links are not allowed for non-existent files either
